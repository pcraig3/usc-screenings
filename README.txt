List of features we want:

*   Create a Screening in the backend
*   Screening populates a list of screenings in the front-end
*   Screening also has its own page

* Not to be cocky, but I think I've nearly wrapped this one up.
* USC Screenings Post Type exists.
* Statuses exist.

*** Still need a single Screening template
*** Still need mobile responsive Screenings

= 0.3.0 =

== Updates ==

The basic structure of this plugin was cloned from the [WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project.
This plugin supports the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin, so if you install that, this plugin becomes automatically updateable direct from GitHub. Any submission to WP.org repo will make this redundant.
